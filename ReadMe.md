# Programming Assignment 4: Flask


In this programming assignment, we are tasked to make a web application using Flask with the back-end using OOP in python.

Here I'm trying to make the web-app as simple as it could be without losing it's design and functionality. I only used Bootstrap and Javascript to make the front-end looks decent, while using the template as the back-end as it's functionality already satisfy my needs. 

- [`budayaKB_controller.py`](https://github.com/Artemis1872/TP4-Flask-BudayaKBLite/blob/master/budayaKB_controller.py "budayaKB_controller.py") contains the Flask part
- [`budayaKB_model.py`](https://github.com/Artemis1872/TP4-Flask-BudayaKBLite/blob/master/budayaKB_model.py "budayaKB_model.py") contains the back-end model
- [`templates`](https://github.com/Artemis1872/TP4-Flask-BudayaKBLite/tree/master/templates "templates") contains all the templates I used for the site
- [`exported.csv`](https://github.com/Artemis1872/TP4-Flask-BudayaKBLite/blob/master/exported.csv "exported.csv") is an auto-generated file when user clicked `Ekspor` button in the web-app and kind of unimportant, just like the rest.

This is a quick and dirty web-app rather a whole complete web-app, as the semester is closing and I have so many assignment to work on.
At first, I wanted to improve this project, especially the GUI part. But I decided not to, because I have too many other suspended projects that I promised to finish.
